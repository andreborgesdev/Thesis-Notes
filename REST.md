# Rest

Most of the time when we hear this term, the first thing that comes to mind is APIs, it's how we build APIs, and JSON, because that's what we get back from these APIs, and that's a pretty common thing to say as all we read and hear about are, well, RESTful APIs that return JSON. But, REST isn't just about building an API which consists of a few HTTP services that return JSON. It's much broader than that.

Rest stand for Representational state transfer is intended to evoke an image of how a well-designed web application behaves, a network of web pages where the user progresses through an application by selecting links (state transitions), resulting in the next page (representing the next state of the application) being transferred to the user and rendered for their use.
